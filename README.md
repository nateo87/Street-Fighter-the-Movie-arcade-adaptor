This board is intended to go between the Jamma connector and the edge connector on the board for the Street Fighter the Movie arcade game.  It's just a simple rerouting of signals since the SFTM board just HAD to be different. 
The two "molex" connectors for the SFTM board can just be your standard pin header sockets; the specific connector housings are not necessary. As for the other parts, you'll need:
- A female Jamma connector
- B10P-SHF-1AA connector (if you're using a CPS1 kick harness)
- DF1BZ-34DP-2.5DSA socket (if you're using a CPS2/3 kick harness)
- wire and female pin headers (2.54mm pitch) for the speaker and heavy kick connections on the main board
And that's all there is to it!
